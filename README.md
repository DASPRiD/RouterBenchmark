Router performance benchmark
============================

**These benchmarks are purely informational, to help identify ways we can**
**improve overall framework performance as part of much larger picture.**

This is a simple suite to compare performance of different routers. For each
router, the exact same routing structure is created. Then, the performance for
both the first route matching and the last route matching is tested.

On an Intel Core i7-3930K CPU @ 3.20GHz, the following results were achieved:

```
RouterBenchmark\DashEvent
    Method Name   Iterations    Average Time      Ops/second
    ----------  ------------  --------------    -------------
    firstMatch: [1,000     ] [0.0003087394238] [3,238.97735]
    lastMatch : [1,000     ] [0.0003219761848] [3,105.81977]


RouterBenchmark\SymfonyEvent
    Method Name   Iterations    Average Time      Ops/second
    ----------  ------------  --------------    -------------
    firstMatch: [1,000     ] [0.0011287193298] [885.95984]
    lastMatch : [1,000     ] [0.0006017644405] [1,661.77981]


RouterBenchmark\Zf2Event
    Method Name   Iterations    Average Time      Ops/second
    ----------  ------------  --------------    -------------
    firstMatch: [1,000     ] [0.0013284144402] [752.77712]
    lastMatch : [1,000     ] [0.0010156590939] [984.58233]
```

You can run the tests yourself with the following command:

```vendor/bin/athletic -p src/```
